## Question  
Explain a recent challenge you faced with Git and how you addressed it.

### 📝 Short Explanation  
This question is intended to assess your experience with Git at scale — especially around collaborative processes and governance. It’s an opportunity to demonstrate how you bring structure to complex codebases across teams.

## ✅ Answer  
A recent challenge I faced was implementing a consistent Git branching strategy across 100+ repositories used by multiple teams in my organization. Each team followed their own style — some had `main/dev`, others used `master/feature`, and a few used no long-lived branches at all. This inconsistency made CI/CD pipelines error-prone, releases chaotic, and collaboration difficult.

To solve this, we standardized on a lightweight **trunk-based branching strategy** with well-defined rules around `main`, `release/*`, and `feature/*` branches — and rolled it out in phases across teams.

### 📘 Detailed Explanation  
At a company-wide level, multiple teams were independently managing Git repos, and the lack of a unified branching approach caused several issues:
- CI pipelines were failing due to missing expected branches like `main` or `release`.
- Some teams rebased public branches, which broke collaborators' work.
- Merge conflicts were common in integration environments.
- Releases were often delayed due to confusion about which branch was production-ready.

Here’s how I addressed it:

#### ✅ Step 1: Analyze the current state
- Audited all repositories using automation (GitHub/GitLab APIs).
- Documented the branching models and naming conventions each team used.

#### ✅ Step 2: Design a unified strategy
- Proposed a **trunk-based development** model:
  - `main` → always production-ready
  - `release/x.y` → for stabilization and hotfixes
  - `feature/*` → short-lived, rebased before merge
- Outlined rules for using `merge`, `rebase`, and protection policies.

#### ✅ Step 3: Rollout with tooling & education
- Created templates (starter repos) with the correct branch structure.
- Set up default branch protections and PR requirements using GitHub Actions and branch policies.
- Ran onboarding sessions and created a lightweight Git handbook tailored to our strategy.

#### ✅ Step 4: Iterate with feedback
- Incorporated feedback from platform, dev, and QA teams.
- Adjusted the policy to allow for temporary exceptions during migration.

The result was:
- 95%+ repos aligned within 2 months.
- CI/CD pipeline reliability improved significantly.
- Teams were clearer on how and when to branch or merge.
- It became easier to onboard new developers and automate release workflows.
